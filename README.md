Some simple functions for analyzing MSIBI results. 

This is a set of FUNctions to aid in visualizing the results from an MS IBI optimiztion. For the MS IBI code, see [this awesome repository](https://github.com/ctk3b/msibi). Details of the MS IBI algorithm can be found [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4880555).

If you use the MS IBI package, please cite the above paper. The BibTeX reference is
